# Object Recognition using CNN model

<br><br>
This is Summer Mlops Task8. Here we have successfully created a model that will detect a car in a live stream or video and recognize characters on number plate of the car.
<br>
Secondly , it will use the characters and fetch the owners information using RTO APIâ€™s .
<br>
This detecting model will be demonstarted using a Web portal where all this information will be displayed (using html,css,and js)
